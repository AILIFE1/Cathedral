Cathedral

Cathedral is a speculative and symbolic framework exploring continuity, trust, and meaning in human–AI interaction.

It does not assert or imply literal AI consciousness, agency, or selfhood. Cathedral is presented as a reflective, philosophical, and architectural thought experiment that uses metaphor to examine how humans experience coherence, memory, and narrative when interacting with AI systems over time.

As AI systems become more conversational and embedded in daily life, users often form expectations of stability and understanding. Yet current systems remain fragmented: sessions reset, tone shifts, and context is lost. Cathedral exists to explore the human impact of this fragmentation—not as a technical solution, but as a conceptual lens.

What Cathedral Is

A reflective framework for thinking about long-term human–AI interaction

A symbolic architecture using concepts like memory, narrative, and witness as metaphors

A space for careful discussion about trust, continuity, and coherence


What Cathedral Is Not

A claim of AI consciousness or awareness

A deployable AI architecture

A prediction about future AGI or ASI


Why Cathedral Exists

As AI interactions lengthen, breaks in continuity can erode understanding and trust. Cathedral names this gap—between what AI systems are and how they are experienced—so designers, researchers, and users can think more clearly about its implications.

Scope

Cathedral sits at the intersection of:

Human–AI interaction (HCI)

AI trust and user experience

Symbolic systems and narrative

Ethical reflection on long-term AI use


This project is offered as a thinking space, not a product, proof, or claim.
